#### A short notice of me

I believe that the future is in the hands of people that understand Human as an individual, as part of a group / tribe / greater entity and as a part of society.

**idea** (philosophy) -> **putting it on a paper** (math / sociology / economics / psychology) -> **building it** (programming!!)  

When building, I think more abstract. Guided by the purpose, I tako into the account the human factor / nature of interest concern / context of everyday life etc.
