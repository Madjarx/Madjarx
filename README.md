I used to make model-planes, it was kinda boring cus all of the pieces were pre-assembled you just had to glue them together. Fun part was adding the "story / identity" for the model :
- coloring, adding weather details
- adding stuff on your own that didnt come in the box

#### A short notice of me

I believe that the future is in the hands of people that understand Human as an individual, as part of a group / tribe / greater entity and as a part of society.

**idea** (philosophy) -> **putting it on a paper** (math / sociology / economics / psychology) -> **building it** (programming!!)  

When building, I think more abstract. Guided by the purpose, I tako into the account the human factor / nature of interest concern / context of happening etc.

We're unaware that in our lives we're driven by subconscious things. Our brain comes and fits that logical conscious narrative for that already made descision.
